Amazon Neptune utility for GraphQL(TM) schemas and resolvers
Version 1.0.0

Description
***********
Create a GraphQL API, Schema and Resolver for Amazon Neptune.
You can start from an existing Amazon Neptune database, or a property graph database schema, or a GraphQL schema. 
The utility generates the GraphQL Schema and the Resolver code to query Amazon Neptune via a GraphQL server.
Optionally the utility can create, update or remove an AppSync GraphQL API, and all the AWS resources to query 
the Amazon Neptune database, or a CDK file. The utility generates an intermediate GraphQL schema that includes the 
directives that inform the resolver how to query the graph databases. If you input a GraphQL schema withput graph 
database directive the utility inference them.

Input options:
- Amazon Neptune endpoint
- Property graph database schema  
- GraphQL schema   

Output:
- AppSync GraphQL API
- GraphQL schema without directives, default name is output.schema.graphql
- GraphQL schema with directives, default name is output.source.schema.graphql
- GraphQL resolver as Node.js code for the AWS Lambda used between AWS AppSync and
  Amazon Neptune, default name is output.lambda.index.mjs
- GraphQL resolver as generic Javascript function
- A file with the list of AWS resources created
- CDK file with the Lambda zip file

Use cases
***********
Input an Amazon Neptune database enpoint
 - the utility capture the graph database schema and output it as file
 - the utility inference and output the GraphQL resolver, including operations like
   queries and mutations.
 - the utility also output the enriched schema with directives. It can be edited and
   used as input to the utility.

Input a GraphQL schema with no directives
 - the utility inference and output the GraphQL resolver, including operations like
   queries and mutations.
 - the utility also output the enriched schema with directives. It can be edited and
   used as input to the utility.

Input a GraphQL schema with directives
 - the utility inference and output the GraphQL resolvers, and a GraphQL schema 
   without directives.

Input a property graph database schema
 - the utility inference and output the GraphQL resolver, including operations like
   queries and mutations.
 - the utility also output the enriched schema with directives. It can be edited and
   used as input to the utility.
 - file format: { 
    "nodeStructures": [
        { "label":"nodelabel1", 
            "properties": [
                { "name":"name1", "type":"type1" }
            ]
        },
        { "label":"nodelabel2", 
            "properties": [
                { "name":"name2", "type":"type1" }
        ]}
    ],
    "edgeStructures": [
        { "label":"label1",
            "directions": [
                { "from":"nodelabel1", "to":"nodelabel2", "relationship":"ONE-ONE|ONE-MANY|MANY-MANY"  }
            ], 
            "properties": [
                { "name":"name1", "type":"type1" }
            ]
        }]
    }

Input a changes file
 - the user can remove or add to the GraphQL schema generated by the utility.
 - Changes file format: [
     { "type": "graphQLTypeName", 
       "field": "graphQLFieldName",       
       "action": "remove|add",
       "value": "value"
    }   
   ]

Create, update or remove the AWS resources pipeline for the AppSync GraphQL API
 - it creates the AWS Lambda execution role
 - it creates or update the AWS Lambda, in the Neptune DB VPC, set the environment variables, 
   and upload the resolver code generated by the utiliy.
 - it create or update the AWS AppSync GraphQL API, the datasource for the AWS Lambda, a function 
   with modified code, upload the schema generated by the utility, map for each query and mutation
   the resolver function.

Create the CDK Files
 - it output a CDK file with the class
 - it output the Lamdbda zip file with the resolver code
